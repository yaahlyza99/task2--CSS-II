    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>A CSS processor is a tool that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code with variables, functions, nesting, and more, which then compiles into standard CSS that browsers can read. Popular CSS preprocessors include: Sass (Syntactically Awesome
        Stylesheets) LESS Stylus
    </p>
    <p>These preprocessors help streamline writing and managing CSS, especially for large projects.</p>
    <h1>Advantages of Using a CSS Processor: Variables: Store values like colors, fonts, and sizes in reusable variables. Nesting: Nest CSS rules in a way that mirrors the HTML structure. Mixins & Functions: Define reusable blocks of code and functions to
        generate styles dynamically. Partials & Imports: Organize CSS into smaller, modular files that can be imported into one main stylesheet.</h1>
