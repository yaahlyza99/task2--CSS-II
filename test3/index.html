    <h1>Explanation</h1>
    <p>
        Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and modules to CSS. Sass files have a .scss or .sass extension and must be compiled into CSS. Differences from CSS: 1 Nesting: Write CSS rules inside
        other rules to reflect the structure of HTML. 2 Partials & Imports: Split large stylesheets into smaller pieces and import them into a main file.
